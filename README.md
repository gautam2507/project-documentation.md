## Project Overview

This project is a demo e-commerce platform that sells astronomy-related products, such as telescopes and space merchandise. It functions similarly to popular e-commerce platforms like Amazon or Flipkart, but with a focus on space-related products.


## Microservices Architecture

This project follows a microservices architecture, where different parts of the application (shopping, cart, catalog, currency, shipping) run as independent services.

Microservices vs. Monolithic Architecture

Monolithic: One large application where everything is tightly connected—harder to scale and update.

Microservices: Each service runs separately, making the system scalable, flexible, and fault-tolerant.

Key Benefits

✅ Independent Scaling & Deployment

✅ Better Fault Tolerance – If one service fails, others keep running

✅ Technology Flexibility – Each service can use a different programming language (e.g., Python for catalog, Java for cart, Node.js for currency)

✅ Faster Development – Teams can work on different services independently


## Key Features

Shopping Service → Users can browse and purchase astronomy products.

Cart & Checkout → Allows users to add products to their cart and place orders.

Currency Service → Supports multiple currencies for international transactions.

Shipping Service → Users can enter their address and track their orders.

Recommendation Service → Suggests products based on previous purchases.

## Running the Project Locally

Running the project locally helps understand its architecture, services, and dependencies.

It allows early identification of issues and ensures environment compatibility.

Helps in verifying setup requirements and optimizing infrastructure.

The README file provides setup instructions, configurations, and dependencies.

Reviewing it ensures smooth deployments and system reliability.

Deploying locally helps understand how the application runs and how different services interact.
