## Project Overview

This project is a demo e-commerce platform that sells astronomy-related products, such as telescopes and space merchandise. It functions similarly to popular e-commerce platforms like Amazon or Flipkart, but with a focus on space-related products.


## Microservices Architecture

This project follows a microservices architecture, where different parts of the application (shopping, cart, catalog, currency, shipping) run as independent services.

Microservices vs. Monolithic Architecture

Monolithic: One large application where everything is tightly connected—harder to scale and update.

Microservices: Each service runs separately, making the system scalable, flexible, and fault-tolerant.

Key Benefits

✅ Independent Scaling & Deployment

✅ Better Fault Tolerance – If one service fails, others keep running

✅ Technology Flexibility – Each service can use a different programming language (e.g., Python for catalog, Java for cart, Node.js for currency)

✅ Faster Development – Teams can work on different services independently


## Key Features

Shopping Service → Users can browse and purchase astronomy products.

Cart & Checkout → Allows users to add products to their cart and place orders.

Currency Service → Supports multiple currencies for international transactions.

Shipping Service → Users can enter their address and track their orders.

Recommendation Service → Suggests products based on previous purchases.

Deploying locally helps understand how the application runs and how different services interact.
## Containerization with Docker: Managing Microservices Efficiently

Docker is a containerization platform that allows applications to run consistently across different environments by packaging them with all necessary dependencies. It provides lightweight, portable, and scalable containers, making it an essential tool for microservices-based applications.

In this project, Docker is used to containerize microservices, ensuring they are easily deployable, scalable, and maintainable. As a DevOps Engineer, understanding Docker’s lifecycle is critical for managing microservices efficiently.
## Docker Lifecycle

1️⃣ Create a Dockerfile

📌 What? A set of instructions that tells Docker how to prepare and package the microservice.

📌 Why? So the application works the same way on any computer or server.

2️⃣ Build a Docker Image

📌 What? Converts the microservice into a portable format.

📌 Why? Allows easy sharing and deployment across different environments.

📌 Command: docker build -t payment-service .

3️⃣ Run a Docker Container

📌 What?

A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. This means your microservice is now actively running inside an isolated environment, ready to handle requests.


📌 Why Do We Need It?

Isolation – The container runs separately from the host system, avoiding conflicts.

Scalability – We can easily start multiple containers to handle more users.

Consistency – Runs the same way on any machine, ensuring no "it works on my machine" issues.

📌 Command:  docker run -d -p 8080:8080 payment-service

### **Containerizing the Product-Catalog Microservice with Docker***  

This section provides the **Dockerfile** for the **Product-Catalog microservice**, defining how the application is built and run inside a container. Using Docker ensures the service is **portable, scalable, and easily deployable** across different environments. 🚀  

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the application  
FROM golang:1.22-alpine AS builder  # Use a lightweight Go 1.22 Alpine image for building the application  

WORKDIR /usr/src/app  # Set the working directory inside the container  

COPY . .  # Copy all project files from the local machine to the container  

RUN go mod download  # Download all dependencies required by the application  

RUN go build -o product-catalog ./  # Build the Go application and create an executable named 'product-catalog'  

# Stage 2: Create a minimal runtime environment  
FROM alpine AS release  # Use a minimal Alpine Linux image for the final container  

WORKDIR /usr/src/app  # Set the working directory inside the container  

COPY ./product ./products  # Copy the 'product' directory into 'products' inside the container (ensure this exists in your project)  

COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/product-catalog ./  # Copy the built application from the builder stage to the runtime stage  

EXPOSE ${PRODUCT_CATALOG_PORT}  # Declare the application port dynamically using an environment variable  

ENTRYPOINT ["./product-catalog"]  # Define the command to run when the container starts  
```




### Why Use a Multi-Stage Dockerfile?

A **multi-stage Dockerfile** helps us create **smaller, faster, and more secure containers** by separating the **build process** from the **final application**.  

### **How It Works (Step-by-Step)**  

1️⃣ **First Stage (Build Stage)**  
   - Uses a **full Go environment** (`golang:1.22-alpine`) to compile the application.  
   - Installs dependencies and builds the app.  

2️⃣ **Second Stage (Runtime Stage)**  
   - Uses a **lightweight Alpine Linux** to run the application.  
   - Copies only the **built application** (not extra files or dependencies).  

### **Why Is This Useful?**  

✅ **Smaller Image** – Removes unnecessary files, making the container lightweight.  
✅ **Faster Deployment** – Smaller images load and run faster.  
✅ **More Secure** – No extra development tools, reducing security risks.  
✅ **Efficient** – Saves storage and speeds up downloads.  

By using **multi-stage builds**, we make our **Product-Catalog microservice** **optimized, secure, and production-ready!** 🚀  



 ### **Pushing Docker Images to Docker Hub**  

 After **containerizing a microservice**, the Docker image is stored **locally** on the machine where it was built. However, to share it with developers, testers, or deployment systems, we need to **push it to a container registry**.  

A **container registry** is a centralized storage location where Docker images are stored and managed. Examples include **Docker Hub, AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and Google Container Registry (GCR)**.  

In our case, we are using **Docker Hub** to store and share our Docker images. This allows developers, testers, and deployment systems to access the image from anywhere.  

### **Steps to Push an Image to Docker Hub**  

1️⃣ **Log in to Docker Hub**  
```bash
docker login
```
This authenticates your Docker CLI with your Docker Hub account.  

---

2️⃣ **Tag the Image**  
```bash
docker tag product-catalog your-dockerhub-username/product-catalog:v1.0
```
- This renames the image to match Docker Hub’s format.  
- Replace `your-dockerhub-username` with your actual Docker Hub username.  

---

3️⃣ **Push the Image to Docker Hub**  
```bash
docker push your-dockerhub-username/product-catalog:v1.0
```
This uploads the image to your **Docker Hub repository**, making it accessible to others.  

---

### **Why Is This Important?**  
✅ **Easily share images with developers and testers**  
✅ **Makes deployment simpler and faster**  
✅ **Allows pulling the image from anywhere**  

Now, your **Product-Catalog microservice** is stored in Docker Hub and ready for use! 🚀
##  Streamlining Microservice Management with Docker Compose

## 📌 Introduction  
Docker Compose simplifies managing multiple microservices by allowing you to define, configure, and run them with a single command. Instead of manually executing multiple `docker run` commands, **Docker Compose automates networking, container startup, and dependencies.**  

---

## ❌ Challenges Without Docker Compose  
- Manually creating networks so containers can communicate.  
- Running multiple `docker run` commands for different services.  
- Ensuring services start in the correct order (e.g., Product Catalog before Add Service).  

---

## ✅ Solution: Docker Compose  
Docker Compose automates these steps using a **single YAML file** (`docker-compose.yml`) and a **single command (`docker-compose up -d`)**.  

---

## ⚙️ How Docker Compose Works?  
Docker Compose uses a `docker-compose.yml` file to:  

- 📌 Define multiple services in one place.  
- 🔄 Automatically handle networking between containers.  
- 📊 Ensure correct startup order with `depends_on`.

## Why Do We Need Container Orchestration?


![](https://github.com/gautam2507/project-documentation.md/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-03-11%20192103.png?raw=true)

Before containerization, applications suffered from deployment issues due to differences in environments. **Docker** solved this problem by packaging applications into containers that run consistently across systems.

However, as the number of containers grows in a production environment, managing them **manually** becomes impractical. This is where **container orchestration** comes into play.

---

## ❌ Problems Without Container Orchestration

### 1️⃣ Service Discovery Issues
- Containers are **ephemeral** (short-lived) and restart with a **new IP address**.
- If services communicate using **IPs**, connections **break** when containers restart.
- A **dynamic service discovery** mechanism is needed to maintain connectivity.

### 2️⃣ Scaling Limitations
- Handling increased traffic requires **manually launching** new containers.
- No built-in mechanism to **automatically adjust resources** based on demand.
- Leads to **slow and inefficient scaling**.

### 3️⃣ No Automatic Recovery
- If a container fails, it **does not restart** automatically.
- Manual intervention is required to bring the system back up.
- In a **production** environment, **self-healing** mechanisms are necessary.

### 4️⃣ Networking & Load Balancing Challenges
- **Traffic distribution** across multiple instances is **not automated**.
- Load balancing must be **configured separately**.
- Managing **container-to-container communication** can become complex.

---

## ✅ How Container Orchestration Helps
A **Container Orchestration Tool** (such as **Kubernetes**) provides solutions to these challenges:

✔ **Service Discovery & Networking** – Containers communicate using **stable service names** instead of IP addresses.  
✔ **Automatic Scaling** – Adjusts the number of running containers dynamically based on **traffic and demand**.  
✔ **Self-Healing** – Detects failures and **restarts** failed containers **automatically**.  
✔ **Load Balancing** – Distributes traffic **efficiently** without **manual intervention**.

## Why Do We Need Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?
 
Managing infrastructure manually using UI or CLI is time-consuming and error-prone. Imagine creating hundreds of EC2 instances manually—it’s inefficient! **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** solves this problem by automating infrastructure provisioning using code.

---

## 🔥 Problems Without IaC

### ❌ Manual Effort  
- Repeating the same steps multiple times is slow.  
- Clicking through the UI or writing CLI commands every time is inefficient.  

### ❌ Human Errors  
- Manually creating resources increases the risk of mistakes.  
- Forgetting a small configuration could lead to security or performance issues.  

### ❌ No Consistency  
- Different team members may configure things differently.  
- Difficult to track and maintain standard infrastructure setups.  

### ❌ Difficult Scaling  
- As infrastructure grows, managing resources manually becomes complex.  
- Handling large-scale cloud environments without automation is impractical.  

---

## ✅ How IaC Solves These Problems  

### 🚀 **Automation**  
- Write code once, reuse it anytime to create or update infrastructure.  
- No need to manually click buttons or run multiple commands.  

### 🔄 **Consistency**  
- Infrastructure is defined in code, ensuring all environments are identical.  
- No more “It works on my machine” issues!  

### 🔍 **Version Control**  
- Store infrastructure code in Git, track changes, and roll back if needed.  
- Just like software code, you can review and improve configurations.  

### 📈 **Scalability**  
- Easily scale up or down by changing a few lines of code.  
- Deploy infrastructure faster with minimal effort.
